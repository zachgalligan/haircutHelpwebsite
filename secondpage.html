               <p> You might think that the first tip on a list of how to keep hair looking good would be to wash it daily. <br>
                <br>
                But regular shampooing can easily dry out your strands, making them brittle and frizzy. Instead, start washing your hair every other day to restore your hair's natural strength and shininess.<br> 
                <br>
                You can adjust your hair-washing schedule to suit your particular texture and oiliness. Curly hair tends to need fewer weekly washes than straight hair, for example.<br> 
                <br>
                Make sure you're using the right hair-washing method, too.<br> </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                There are plenty of ways to stall the hair-thinning process. One of them takes just a few minutes post-shower. <br>
                <br>
                Start patting your hair dry, rather than tousling it with a towel. Rubbing your hair can create friction, which causes breakage of the strands. <br>
                <br>
                Even if thinning isn't yet on your radar, you might want to try the hair-patting method to make styling easier. Broken strands aren't as easy to control and style as healthy, smooth hair. <br>
               <br> 
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>

               <br>
               If you can't get in for a haircut, your edges will always be what gives you away. <br>
               <br>
               You don't want to give yourself a full-on haircut, of course. But if you buy a small razor, you can keep your edges manicured between visits to the barbershop. <br>
               <br>
               In the past, you might've depended on your barber to keep your edges in order. Now, though, you can quickly buzz away neck fuzz and other messy-looking growth. This step will extend the life of your haircut so you don't have to go to the barber as frequently. <br>
               <br>
               Even when the salons reopen, you can continue doing this, too. You'll end up saving money and time on hairstyling if you take care of this step yourself.<br>
